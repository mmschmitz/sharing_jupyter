# sharing_jupyter
Sharing location for my Jupyter notebooks, and in rare instances, Python scripts written in base Python when Jupyter cannot import certain modules (i.e., Geopandas!).

(I am aware that Geopandas is usually supposed to show up on Jupyter. However, I have been getting the same error as 
this issue mentioned here, simply when importing geopandas: https://github.com/conda-forge/geopandas-feedstock/issues/38.)
