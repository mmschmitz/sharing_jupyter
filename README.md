# sharing_jupyter
Sharing location for my Jupyter notebooks, and in rare instances, codes when Jupyter can't import in certain modules (hello, Geopandas!).

I started this repository after trying to debug Jupyter notebooks - which, for the last day or two, have been my way of getting over jet lag from a 32-hour flight odyssey from eastern Africa.

It's been on my bucket list to stop being a lurker and actually 'get serious' about data analysis in languages that aren't just SAS or Stata - which have been my industry standard for the last few years. This means dipping my toes back into R and Python. I learned the basics of R when I was in undergrad through my statistics minor, and Python 2 back at my first job after I graduated from university. While I still keep up my Python knowledge by writing functions in ArcGIS, it's been a process in trying to get back into it, and actually getting good at it again.

I can be reached at this repository. (Other contact details are on my profile.)
